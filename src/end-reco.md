# Simon's Recommendations

1. Use clone,ref,as_ref to silence the borrow checker
2. Avoid Box, Cell, RefCell, Arc, Mutex, etc
3. Avoid Generics in the beginning
4. Avoid writing your own macros
5. Aim for understanding async and multithreading, channels soon (very valuable) -> Next Session
6. Now you need Arc and maybe Mutex
7. Build a small real application (cli tool, website, Client App)
8. Forget about OOD. Rust is all about procedural programming with a strong typesystem. https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-00-oop.html
